//PSEUDOCODE

//Setup a (self-executing?) function{
//		that has variables inside for both players' Names;
//		Max-Damage, and;
//		Starting Health;
//		as well as a variable for the current Round;
//
//
//	Setup a function within it named "fight" that loops through rounds and reduces the playerâ€™s health accordingly{
//		Setup an alert that shows the first player's name and health, the round number, and the second player's name and health;
//
//  	Create a (for) loop that will run 10 rounds{
//			Create a variable for the minumum player 1 damage and set the value to player 1's max damage *.5;
//			Create a variable for the minimum player 2 damage and set the value to player 2's max damage *.5;
//			Create 2 variables and set both of their values to a formula for generating a random number (for damage). For player 1;
//			And player 2;
//
//			Create two expressions that update the newly-decremented healths of both players (using the random numbers from above);
//
//			Call the winnerCheck function; (store the call in a variable named "results")
//
//		}; < Ends For Loop
//  	
//
//	}; < Ends "fight" function
//
//	Setup another function named "winnerCheck" that does the conditional logic to determine if there is a winner or not{
//		Create a variable with a string value stating that there is no winner;
//
//		Create an if statement that compares player healths to see if they're both under 1{
//			If this is the case, the result should be a string with something like "You Both Die";
//		}If not, just check if player 1's health is less than 1{
//			And then return something like "(Player 2 name) wins";
//		}If not, just check player 2's health{
//			And, if that's the case, return something like "(Player 1 name) wins";
//		};
//
//		Return the result;
//
//
//	}; < Ends "winnerCheck" function
//
//
//	Call the "fight" function;
